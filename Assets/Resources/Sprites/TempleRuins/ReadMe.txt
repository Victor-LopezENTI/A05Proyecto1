Pro Tips:

#1 
Since most of the assets are pretty simple in term of color & art style, it lets you blend them together pretty easily. That's why I've only used one color for the plants, for example. Same for the stone elements which have only the same 3-4 colors, so you can easily modify them if you want to make different zones in your game, for example!

#2
You can stretch the "Background" elements (Background_Fog, Background_Shadow, etc) to use them as you want :) You can check the Gifs I've made to understand how I used them. 
It helps a lot to separate the different layers for your game, and make everything more understandable for the player (background, player layer, foreground, etc).

#3
It's a more personnal advice, but never forget to keep it simple! 
To add details is a very important thing but be sure to do not put all the props everywhere. Keep some of them for specific moments to make every place unique and personnal.
